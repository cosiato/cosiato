## Philosophy

```
Ship > Perfect
Learn > Know
Build > Talk
```

I believe in:
- **Rapid prototyping** - let's build amazing apps in days
- **Building in public** — sharing wins and failures
- **Small teams, big output** — or solo if needed
- **Web3 for everyone** — not just crypto natives

## What I am doing

- Shipping B2C products at speed with AI superpowers
- Documenting my journey and learnings
- Building the dApp that brings web3 to the mainstream

I don't have all the answers, but I'm figuring it out one commit at a time.
